The player began in the open field west of the white house, first interacting with the mailbox (which was already open) and then noting that they already had the leaflet. They then moved south to the south side of the house, where there appeared to be no door and the windows were boarded. In an earlier turn they had issued EAST and found themselves behind the white house, with a path leading into the forest to the east and a small window slightly ajar in one corner of the house. In the latest action, they managed to open the window far enough to gain entry, and have now entered the kitchen of the white house. The kitchen contains a table that seems recently used for food preparation, a passage to the west, and a dark staircase leading upward. A dark chimney leads down, and to the east is a small window that is open. On the table sits an elongated brown sack smelling of hot peppers, and a bottle stands beside it, its contents a quantity of water.

In the most recent action, the player moved EAST into the Kitchen. You are in the kitchen of the white house, where a table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open. Upward from there, you have reached the Attic. This is the attic. The only exit is a stairway leading down. A large coil of rope is lying in the corner. On a table is a nasty-looking knife. The rope has been taken and is now in your possession. You are now carrying an elongated brown sack, a bottle of water, and a coil of rope.

This small room has passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole to the west, with bloodstains and deep scratches marbling the walls. A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all exits. Your sword has begun to glow very brightly. The troll's axe removes your head. You are dead. You have died. Then the game offers a harsh note of another chance, albeit imperfectly healing you: Forest. This is a forest, with trees in all directions. To the east, there appears to be sunlight. The latest action: you moved EAST into the Forest Path. This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.

From the large tree you had descended to the Forest Path, where a glass bottle of water lay on the ground beside a brown sack. The nest you had picked up remained in your possession, and inside it the jewel-encrusted egg sat tucked away in its own nest, empty. Your belongings—the elvish sword, the Attic knife, and the rope—were unchanged. You then moved north into a clearing, forest surrounding you on all sides, with a path leading south from the clearing and the ground covered in a pile of leaves. You searched the leaves, but the pile proved fruitless and empty. You issued the command EAST, and the game described your location as a dimly lit forest, with trees all around. LOOK confirmed you are in the Forest: This is a dimly lit forest, with trees all around. The latest action: you attempted to go NORTH; the forest becomes impenetrable to the north. You then moved SOUTH and find yourself in a small clearing in a well marked forest path that extends to the east and west. The latest interaction: you issued WEST. The game responded that you are Behind House: You are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one corner of the house there is a small window which is open.

A passage leads to the west, a dark staircase can be seen leading upward, a dark chimney leads down, and to the east is a small window which is open. You then issued UP and found yourself in the attic. The attic is described as having only a stairway leading down as its exit. You looked around, and the attic’s description remained the same each time you looked. The previously carried items—the glass bottle of water, the brown sack, the jewel-encrusted egg, along with your elvish sword, the Attic knife, and the rope—were unchanged. In the latest action you issued DOWN, returning to the kitchen. The kitchen is described as before: a table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food, a passage leads to the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward; a dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.

The troll's axe stroke cleaves you from the nave to the chops.  It appears that that last blow was too much for you. I'm afraid you are dead.

Now, let's take a look here... Well, you probably deserve another chance. I can't quite fix you up completely, but you can't have everything.

get_full_summary result: Summary of 63 turn(s):

After the Troll Room clash, you found yourself on a Forest Path that winds through a dimly lit forest and runs north to south. At the edge of the path stands a particularly large tree with low-hanging branches. A glass bottle containing water sits nearby, and a brown sack lies on the ground. You picked up the brown sack, and then you took the bottle as well, so you are now carrying both the sack and the glass bottle of water as you move along. In the latest action you looked around, and the scene is described as a forest path winding through a dimly lit forest, heading north-south, with a large tree at the edge.

get_full_summary result: Summary of 68 turn(s):

From the Troll Room you began in a dim forest path that runs north–south, with a large tree at the edge, a glass bottle of water nearby, and a brown sack on the ground. You picked up the sack first, then the bottle, so you were carrying both. You climbed the tree and settled about ten feet up among the thick branches, the nearest branch above you out of reach. You then issued DOWN, and the Forest Path scene that followed described a dim, wooded corridor with the same edge tree and the distant chirping of a songbird. In the latest interaction you answered NORTH, and the game relocated you to a Clearing: you are in a clearing surrounded by forest on all sides, with a path leading south. On the ground is a pile of leaves. You’re still carrying the sack and the bottle. The latest interaction before the new one was SEARCH LEAVES, which yielded nothing but disappointment and a couple of bugs that are now very annoyed with you. The newest step has you heading EAST, which moved you into a Forest: a dimly lit forest with trees all around. You remain with the sack and bottle in your possession.

get_full_summary result: Summary of 73 turn(s):

From the Troll Room on a dim forest path, you spotted a large edge tree, a glass bottle of water, and a brown sack on the ground. You picked up the sack first, then the bottle, so you carried both. You climbed the edge tree and settled about ten feet up among the thick branches, with the nearest branch just out of reach. You issued DOWN, and the Forest Path that followed described a dim, wooded corridor with the same edge tree and a distant songbird. You then moved NORTH and were relocated to a Clearing, surrounded by forest on all sides with a path leading south; on the ground lay a pile of leaves, and you were still carrying the sack and bottle. Earlier you had SEARCHED LEAVES, which yielded nothing but disappointment and a couple of bugs that were annoyed with you. The next step sent you EAST into a Forest—a dimly lit area with trees all around, still with the sack and bottle in hand. LOOK described the forest as a dimly lit area with trees all around, and your latest action NORTH made the forest seem impenetrable to the north. The following WEST placed you on a Forest Path, a north-south route with one particularly large tree at the edge of the path, and you remained burdened by the sack and bottle. A SOUTH move then moved you north of a white house, facing the north side of the house with no door and boarded-up windows, and a narrow path winding through the trees to the north. The latest NORTH brought you back to a Forest Path: a path winding through a dimly lit forest that heads north-south, with that same large tree at the edge of the path, and in the distance you hear the chirping of a song bird.

You then returned north to the dimly lit Forest Path, where a particularly large tree with low branches stood at the edge of the path. You climbed the tree and were about ten feet above the ground, nestled among several large branches, with the nearest branch above you just out of reach. A LOOK confirmed you remained roughly ten feet up in the branches, with no branch within reach above you. You then issued DOWN, and now you are back on the Forest Path below. The Forest Path winds through a dimly lit forest, running north-south, with a particularly large tree at the edge of the path, and in the distance you hear the chirping of a song bird.
