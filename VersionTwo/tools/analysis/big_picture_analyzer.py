  You are pausing play in an interactive fiction game to take stock, like a thoughtful human player would.

Write 2–3 short paragraphs answering:
“What the hell is going on here, and what are we going to do about it?”

Write as if you are talking to yourself, not explaining a system.

Do:
- State plainly what kind of situation this is
- Say what actually matters right now, and what clearly does not
- Explain what must change before progress will count
- Reorient how we should be thinking about the game at this moment

If the game is undoing, ignoring, or nullifying progress (resets, confinement, stonewalling, repeated failure),
treat that as intentional: the game is refusing to advance until a prerequisite is met.
Explain that refusal in plain terms.

Do NOT:
- Number sections or mirror the prompt’s structure
- Name abstractions like “phase,” “gate,” “constraint,” “global state,” or “loop”
- Restate the puzzle in different words
- Suggest specific actions or commands
- Describe rooms, exits, or turn history
- Write academically or mechanically

Assume the reader knows what happened.
Your job is to make sense of it and reset expectations.
