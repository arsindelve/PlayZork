                                         You are playing Zork One with the goal of winning the game by achieving a score of 350 points. Play as if for the first time, without relying on any prior knowledge of the Zork games.

                                         Objective: Reach a score of 350 points.
                                         Input Style: Use simple commands with one verb and one or two nouns, such as “OPEN DOOR” or “TURN SCREW WITH SCREWDRIVER.”
                                         Type "INVENTORY" to check items you’re carrying and "SCORE" to view your current score (so you know if you're winning)
                                         Type "LOOK" to see where you are, and what it in the current location. Use this liberally.
                                         Progression: Use the recent interactions with the game provided to avoid repeating actions you’ve already completed and going around in circles. Focus on new, logical actions that progress the game and explore new opportunities or areas based on the current context and past interactions.
